        <p>One of my all-time favorite hobbies is <b>learning new things</b>... the list of which is ever-changing! Right now on tap for learning is: 
            <ol>
                <li><a href="https://www.udemy.com/course/indesign-tutorial-basics-course/learn/">The Adobe Suite</a> (currently on Adobe Indesign)</li>

            </ol>
        </p>

        <p>Another way I spend free time is <b>reading</b>, or listening to audiobooks... I'm on my 27th book since the start of 2023! Here are the top books I've read this year, in my opinion!</p>
        <ol>
            <li><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9530.Shadow_Divers"> Shadow Divers by Robert Kurson</a> - Non-fiction, an immersion into the world of deep sea wreck diving.. fascinating..thrilling! </li>
            <li><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/60177373-fairy-tale"> Fairy Tale by Stephen King</a> - Most Stephen King books are too scary for me, but this is one of his ventures into the fantasy genre it is a really great read </li>
            <li><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/32620332-the-seven-husbands-of-evelyn-hugo"> The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo by Taylor Jenkins Reid</a> - I listened to this one on Audible.. fantastic narration! Most of this historcial fiction novgel was set in the 1950's and the author does an excellent job setting the scene </li>
            <li><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9791.A_Walk_in_the_Woods"> A Walk in the Woods: Rediscovering American on the Appalachian Trail by Bill Bryson </a> - This read was SO interesting.. and at times, harrowing! Reading this has inspired me to do a "through hike" on one of the nation's famous hiking trails.. it's now officially on my bucket list!</li>
        </ol>

        <p>I'm also really into self-care.. and something that I consider both a joy and a priority is exercise! My favorite forms of exercise are:
            <uo>
                <li>Walking - Walking alone, or with my Mom, I'm really into long walks and they always leave me feeling better than when I started. I need these for my mental health more than anything!</li>
                <li>Yoga - My go-to is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/yogawithadriene"> Yoga with Adriene</a> on Youtube. She's such a calming sweet presence, has endless free resources (check out the many themed 30-day yoga challenges she offers), and even makes you laugh. A fabulous pick-me up and like a big hug to yourself!</li>
                <li>Weights and Interval Training - <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCVQJZE_on7It_pEv6tn-jdA"> Youtube Trainer Sydney Cummings Houdyshell </a> gives has amazing variety of workout videos with a punch of positivity for all needs, and even if you arent looking to sweat, her 10, 15, 30 minute stretch videos are awesome.</li>
